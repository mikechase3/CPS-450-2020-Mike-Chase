## Review of Traditional Software Applications

Software applications are computer programs that are developed by software vendors and developers such that they are installed on particular platforms like Windows/Mac. They perform computation and store data in the end-user's machine. The more powerful the user's computer is, the better performance those applications often have.

## Software as a Service

* This is one of the two key concepts.
* Service oriented architecture
  * Computation tasks are composed of services, mostly web services based on the web.
* Virtualization
  * All resources including hardware, software, data, and network are virtualized.
