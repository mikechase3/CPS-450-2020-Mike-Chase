## Design Process

![Design to Application Models. Reg boxes signal what we&apos;ll use.](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28216%29.png)

## Design Activities

* Application component is a well-defined unit of software that performs some functions.
* Issues involve how to package components including
  * Scope and size: what are the functions, boundaries, interfaces?
  * Programming Language: what are the accepted languages?
  * Build or buy: is an acceptable version available to purchase?
* What technology or programming languages will we use?

### Actual Implementation

![A simple web-app example](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28215%29.png)

* This prototype needs to be developed for Sprint 1.
* Deploy it using Node.js, a real-time web application using WebSocket for real-time two direction communications.

## Introduction to Node.js

* A JavaScript programming framework to develop highly-scalable internet applications
* Executed on an interpreter, not a web browser.

### Getting Started

* Use `https://nodejs.org`
  * Binary distributions and source code are available.

### Modules in Node.js

* External modules are available on `www.npmjs.com`
  * Popular packages are available: `https://www.npmjs.com/browse/star`
  * This is the largest package database across all platforms/programming languages
*
