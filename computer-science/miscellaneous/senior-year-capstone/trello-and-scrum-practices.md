# Trello & SCRUM Practices

## SCRUM Purpose

* SCRUM helps you develop in a tesm.
* **Project Backlog**: a prioritized list of user requirements for your project. What are the requirements?
* **Product Owner:** The owner is the person controlling the backlog
* **Scrum Master**: The project manager. 

## SCRUM Cycles \(Sprints\)

SCRUM is controlled by tight, smaller projects.

### Backlog & Team Planning

* Choose what to do from the Sprint Backlog
* Move the item in the backlog to the _sprint backlog_
* You want a working prototype after the 30-day cycle.

### Popular SCRUM tools

* nTask
* Jira: _what we use at Air Force Research Labs_
* TargetProcess
* Trello: worse, but free.

### Required Lists

| List | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |

| Sprint Backlog | Keeps a backlog of the current sprint. |
| In-Progress | Tasks which are being performed |
| Completed | Keeps completed cards.  |

### Gnatt Charts

Gnatt charts are bar charts which illustrate a project schedule. We set a start and end date for each task card.

## Plans for Development

### The Software Process

1. **Specification**: Define what the system should do.
2. **Design and Implementation:** defining the organization of the system and implementing the system
3. **Validation:** checking that it does what the
4. **Evolution:** changing the system in response to changing customer needs.

### Plan-Driven & Agile Processes

* Plan-driven processes are processes where all of the process activities are planned in advance and progress is measured against this plan.
* In agile processes, planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements.
* In practice, most practical processes include elements of both plan-driven and agile approaches. 
* There are no right or wrong software processes.
