## System Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements are statements of services the system should provide, how the system should react to particular inputs, and how the system should behave in particular situations. It also may state what the system should not do.

* The requirements that your system needs.
* Hardware-based.
* Write it in the description.
* I need a _mouse_ and _keyboard_.

### Non-Functional Requirements

* **Definition:** constraints on the services or functions offered by the system such as timing constraints, constraints on the development process, standards, etc.
* They often apply to the system as a whole rather than individual features or services.
  * Security or performance.

## Agile Methods and Requirements

* Don't produce detailed system requirements because they change so quickly.
  * The requirements document is therefore always out of daye
* Use incremental requirements engineering.

## Models and Modeling

### What are models?

**Models:** a representation of some aspect of the system being built. Types of models:

### Types of Models

* Textual Model: something written down & described.
* Graphical models: diagram/schematic
* Mathematical models: Formulas, statistics, algorithms

### Unified Modeling Language \(UML\)

* Standard graphical modeling systems/terminology used for information systems.

## Messenger Project Requirements

* Review_: Agile methods use incremental requirements engineering and may express requirements as user stories._
