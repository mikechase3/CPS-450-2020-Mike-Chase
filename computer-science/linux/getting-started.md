# Getting Started

This is useless for anyone else but Mike Chase. This is just stuff he doesn't already know.

| Command | Caption |
| :--- | :--- |
| CTRL+C | Abort command |
| FG | Puts the command back into foreground |
| CTRL+S | Suspends an app. |
| CTRL+Q | Resumes the suspended app. |
| clear | Clears the screen. Like `cls` for windows. |
| alias | Usage: `alias ri = 'rm -i'`. Puts it in your bash profile hopefully. |

## C-Compiler

`sudo apt-get install gcc` should install the C compiler.
