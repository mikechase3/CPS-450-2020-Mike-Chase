# Python Basics

## Naming Conventions

{% embed url="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\#id34" %}

{% page-ref page="pep-8-style-guide.md" %}



* Variables are lowercase.
* Classes are uppercase.

### Variables

Python likes to name things with underscores, not camelCase.

```python
# Define the release and runtime integer variables below:
year = 1999
runtime_of_crap = 2
```

### Reveal Variable Type

* Use the type\(\) function.
* `print(type(what_is_this_mysterious_variable))`

### Classes

* Class names are upper case.

## Documentation & Type Hints

### Comments

```python
//This is me being an idiot. #Thank God for syntax highlighting. 
```

### [Docstrings](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/docstrings) \(See Programiz\)

#### Example 1: Docstrings

```text
def square(n):
    '''Takes in a number n, returns the square of n'''
    return n**2
```

Here, the string literal:

```text
'''Takes in a number n, returns the square of n'''
```

Inside the triple quotation marks is the **docstring** of the function `square()` as it appears right after its definition.

**Note:** We can also use triple `"""` quotations to create docstrings.

#### Python \_\_doc\_\_ attribute

Whenever string literals are present just after the definition of a function, module, class or method, they are associated with the object as their `__doc__` attribute. We can later use this attribute to retrieve this docstring.

_Example 2: Printing docstring_

```text
def square(n):
    '''Takes in a number n, returns the square of n'''
    return n**2

print(square.__doc__)
```

**Output**

```text
Takes in a number n, returns the square of n
```

Here, the documentation of our `square()` function can be accessed using the `__doc__` attribute.

#### Using the help\(\) Function for Docstrings

We can also use the `help()` function to read the docstrings associated with various objects.

_Example 7: Read Docstrings with the help\(\) function:_

We can use the `help()` function on the class `Person` in **Example 6** as:

```text
help(Person)
```

### Type Hints for Built in Types

```python
from typing import List, Set, Dict, Tuple, Optional

# For simple built-in types, just use the name of the type
x: int = 1
x: float = 1.0
x: bool = True
x: str = "test"
x: bytes = b"test"

# For collections, the name of the type is capitalized, and the
# name of the type inside the collection is in brackets
x: List[int] = [1]
x: Set[int] = {6, 7}

# Same as above, but with type comment syntax
x = [1]  # type: List[int]

# For mappings, we need the types of both keys and values
x: Dict[str, float] = {'field': 2.0}

# For tuples of fixed size, we specify the types of all the elements
x: Tuple[int, str, float] = (3, "yes", 7.5)

# For tuples of variable size, we use one type and ellipsis
x: Tuple[int, ...] = (1, 2, 3)

# Use Optional[] for values that could be None
x: Optional[str] = some_function()
# Mypy understands a value can't be None in an if-statement
if x is not None:
    print(x.upper())
# If a value can never be None due to some invariants, use an assert
assert x is not None
print(x.upper())
```

### Type Hints & Functions

```python
from typing import Callable, Iterator, Union, Optional, List

# This is how you annotate a function definition
def stringify(num: int) -> str:
    return str(num)

# And here's how you specify multiple arguments
def plus(num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
    return num1 + num2

# Add default value for an argument after the type annotation
def f(num1: int, my_float: float = 3.5) -> float:
    return num1 + my_float

# This is how you annotate a callable (function) value
x: Callable[[int, float], float] = f

# A generator function that yields ints is secretly just a function that
# returns an iterator of ints, so that's how we annotate it
def g(n: int) -> Iterator[int]:
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        yield i
        i += 1

# You can of course split a function annotation over multiple lines
def send_email(address: Union[str, List[str]],
               sender: str,
               cc: Optional[List[str]],
               bcc: Optional[List[str]],
               subject='',
               body: Optional[List[str]] = None
               ) -> bool:
    ...

# An argument can be declared positional-only by giving it a name
# starting with two underscores:
def quux(__x: int) -> None:
    pass

quux(3)  # Fine
quux(__x=3)  # Error
```

I grabbed these from the [Mypy documentation](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html). Check it out for more details. 

## Math

### Exponents

Instead of `Math.pow(3, 2)` we have the `**` operator. ðŸ”¥

```python
# This keeps track of how many squares you need in quilts.

# Calculation of squares for:
# 6x6 quilt
print(6**2) #This is 6^2
# 7x7 quilt
print(7**2)
# 8x8 quilt
print(8**2)
# How many squares for 6 people to have 6 quilts each that are 6x6?
print(6**4) #6^4
```

### Compound Operators

> Naturally, similar assignment forms exist for the rest of arithmetic operations: `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `//=`, `%=`, `**=`. Given the opportunity, use them to save time and effort.

## Strings

### Slicing

#### Get the last few characters

```python
favorite_fruit = 'blueberry'
print(favorite_fruit[-1])
# => 'y'
 
print(favorite_fruit[-2])
# => 'r'
 
print(favorite_fruit[-3:])
# => 'rry'
```



### Concatenation

{% hint style="warning" %}
This one always gets me.
{% endhint %}

You can't add non-strings to strings.

```python
print("Hello" + 3) //Error.

print("Hello "+ (str) (3) //Hello 3

--
#Example: source codecademy
birthday_string = "I am "
age = 10
birthday_string_2 = " years old today!"

# Concatenating an integer with strings is possible if we turn the integer into a string first
full_birthday_string = birthday_string + str(age) + birthday_string_2

# Prints "I am 10 years old today!"
print(full_birthday_string)

# If we just want to print an integer 
# we can pass a variable as an argument to 
# print() regardless of whether 
# it is a string.

# This also prints "I am 10 years old today!"
print(birthday_string, age, birthday_string_2)
```

### Multi-Line Strings

It's just like swift.

```python
my_sad_poem = """
Roses are red
Violets are blue.
I like learning python.
But I wish I was doing it with you.
"""
```

### Eval\(\)

* Use eval\(\) to have python evaluate a regular expression.

### I**n keyword**

* `in` checks if one string is part of another string.

```python
print("e" in "blueberry")
# => True
print("a" in "blueberry")
# => False
```

### String Methods

* `.upper()`, `.title()`, and `.lower()` adjust the casing of your string.
* `.split()` takes a string and creates a list of substrings.
* `.join()` takes a list of strings and creates a string.
* `.strip()` cleans off whitespace, or other noise from the beginning and end of a string.
* `.replace()` replaces all instances of a character/string in a string with another character/string.
* `.find()` searches a string for a character/string and returns the index value that character/string is found at.
* `.format()` allows you to interpolate a string with variables.

Checkout Codecademy's [cheat sheet](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science/tracks/cspath-python-objects/modules/cspath-python-strings/cheatsheet) for this topic. Scroll down on that page & you'll see the methods.

![Codecademy&apos;s Summary of String Methods](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png)

#### String Format

You can insert keywords to make your code more legible.: 

```python
def favorite_song_statement(song, artist):
    return "My favorite song is {song_label} by {artist_label}.".format(song_label=song, artist_label=artist)
```

## Functions

### Returning Multiple Values

We can return multiple values. It's so amazing!

```python
def get_boundaries(target, margin):
  low_limit = target-margin
  high_limit = margin+target
  return low_limit, high_limit

low_limit, high_limit = get_boundaries(100, 20)
```

### Assigning Default Values

* When specifying parameters, you can assign default values.
* Here, if nothing is passed, `num_repeats` is assigned to 10 by default

```python
def repeat_stuff(stuff, num_repeats=10):
  return stuff*num_repeats
repeat_stuff("Row ", 3) #repeats 3 times because we specified that. 
lyrics = repeat_stuff("Row ", 3) + "Your Boat. "
song = repeat_stuff(lyrics)

print(song) #Repeats 10 times because it uses the default value.
```

## Expressions

### Booleans

{% hint style="warning" %}
Use capital letters for `True` and `False`. 
{% endhint %}

```python
statement_one = True

statement_two = False

statement_three = True
```

## Error Handling

* You "raise" errors instead of throwing them.
* You except errors instead of catching them.
* Trying is still the same as Java.

```python
def raises_value_error():
  try:
    raise ValueError
  except ValueError:
    print("You raised a ValueError!")
raises_value_error()
```



## User Input

* The `input()` function reads a line from the user and returns it in a program as a string.

```python
user_name = input()
print("Hello, " + user_name) #You don't need to cast this, already str.
```

### Specify Clear Messages

* State clearly the type of input we expect from our user.
* The `input()` function takes an optional argument, a message.

```python
user_name = input("Please, enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + user_name)

# The user will see this:
Please, enter your name: Sauron
Hello, Sauron
```

### Type Check

You can check that a value works by typecasting it or using the type function to check if the type is equal to the expected type; however, the latter isn't recommended because of a corner case of "4" and "4.0" and the user won't know better. If you choose the ladder, just use an 'or' to make sure that it's a float/int and cast it over to what it needs to be. Actually, that's probably best now that I. think about it.

* If the user doesn't enter any input, the program will not execute any further.
* All input is always type `str`. You have to cast it if you want anything else:
* _An error will appear_ if the user enters a value that cannot be converted.

```python
print("What's your favorite number?")
value = int(input()) # now, the value keeps an integer number. 
```

## Command Line Arguments

* Arguments passed in through the command line come in as a tuple.

```python
def main(): # function, method are the same
    host = "www.google.com"

    # Check Command Line Input to make sure some stuff was entered.
    print("Number of arguments: " + str(len(sys.argv)) + " arguments")
    if (1 == len(sys.argv)):
        print("You didn't specify a host name, so we're using Google")
    else:
        host = sys.argv.__getitem__(1)
        print("The host you specified was: " + host)
    print("===============================================\nNow commencing Dr. Yao's Code... \n")
```
