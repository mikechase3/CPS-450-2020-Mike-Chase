* Regex Expressions
* Make your own programming languages
* Compiled v. Interpreted languages and their comparative advantages/disadvantages.
  * Compiled has higher performance, but is harder to debug.
  * Running environments, syntax/semantics, and code syntax paradigms.

### Languages We'll Learn

1. Fortran 77
2. C & C++
3. Java
4. Python
5. **Racket**, a functional language of scheme. It has an open source IDE called Dr. Racket
