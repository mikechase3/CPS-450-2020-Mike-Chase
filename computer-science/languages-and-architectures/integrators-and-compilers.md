# Concepts & Implementations

## Concepts and Implementations of Languages

* Office hours are by appointment only.
* Ask the difference between abstract types and static methods.
* Homework: read chapter 1.

### What We'll Learn

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28115%29.png)

* Regex Expressions
* Make your own programming languages
* Compiled v. Interpreted languages and their comparative advantages/disadvantages.
  * Compiled has higher performance, but is harder to debug.
  * Running environments, syntax/semantics, and code syntax paradigms.

### Languages We'll Learn

1. Fortran 77
2. C & C++
3. Java
4. Python
5. **Racket**, a functional language of scheme. It has an open source IDE called Dr. Racket

## Introduction to Programming Languages

### Hybrid Implementation Systems

* They are trade-offs between compiled and interperted environments.
* A translation to intermediate code is required before running.
* Easy transplanting
* Applicability of code optimization?
* **Disadvantages:** More costly than pure compiled languages & debuggins is not easy.

{% hint style="warning" %}
What is transplanting? Does that just mean it's easy to move from one system to another? What about 'Applicability of code optimization?'
