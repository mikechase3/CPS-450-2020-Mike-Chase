### Brief History

* The foundation for the current era.
* In 2986, the rediscovery of the backpropogation training algorithm leverages the chain rule of derivates helpes the algorithm learn from its mistakes.
* The internet helped advance algorithms.
* GPUs became more popular and deep learning became much easier.

### Artificial Neural Networks \(ANN\)

* They are designed to act like human brains.
* They can handle anomolies.
* Uses many layers of non-linear processing units.

## [Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk)

* This is a way better [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) I found that explains how deep learning works.
* Layers of Networks
  * Input layer
  * Hidden layers
  * Output layers.
* The basic unit is a **node** or artifical neuron.
