# Lesson 01: Course Overview and Asymptotic Notations
## About This Course
1. More detailed algorithms
2. Divide and conquor techniques.
4. Greedy Algorithms
5. Dynamic Programming
6. Linear Programming: *Using linear functions to solve problems*
7. NP Complete Problems *and how to find approximations*

## Why is this useful?
1. More complicated problems
2. **Routing** *for weights when theyâ€™re really complicated. Routing describes how nodes are connected.*
3. Scheduling
4. Caching: *Servers each data to reduce the time & delay, but what should you cache?.*
5. Resource Allocation
6. Teaches us how to solve new problems.
## Understanding Dynamic Programming
1. Find solutions to smaller problems
2. Save it somewhere.
3. Increase the problem size by 1, but use the previous solution in your new solution.

## Internet Routing
1. Fnid the shortest path from a computer in UD to a computer somewhere in Europe.
2. When the graphs are small, it's easy to solve it.
3. When the graph is large, the global is unknown.
4. **Dijkstra's Algorith:** is used to find the shortest path.

## Other Examples
1. Decentralized where each router knows physically connected neighbors.
2. Link costs to neighbors are considered.
3. Bellmand-Ford algorithm are uesd.

## Dynamic Graphs
1. In CPS 350 we used static graphs.
2. What if it's **Dynamic** and changes quickly?

## Further Practice
1. Leetcode: *Median of Two Sorted Arrays* (Solveable only by divide/conquer.)
2.
