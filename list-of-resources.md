### [Languages and Architectures](computer-science/languages-and-architectures/)

#### Codecademy Cheatsheets

[Codecademy Cheatsheets](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/cheatsheets/all) contains a wonderful collection of cheatsheets for multiple languages and tons of subjects. Make sure to check out their [student center](https://www.codecademy.com/student-center) too!

#### Effective Python, Java, CSS, Typescript, More.

\_\_[Effective Python](https://effectivepython.com/)_/Java/C++/Typescript/More_ are books that tell you how to get from mediocrity to mastery by identifying best practices. This is a poor choice for beginners, but great once you get familiar with the programming language by showing you a bit under the hood and helping you learn better practices for each language.

#### Jetbrains Academy \(aka Hyperskill\)

\_\_[Jetbrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/) contains a variety of hands-on learning projects for Python, Java, Javascript, Klotin. They are state-of-the-art. It grades your code style and works directly in IDEs like PyCharm and IntelliJ. This resource costs $50/month, but is worth it for one month or powering through a free-trial.

#### MyPy \(Python\)

MyPy is a Python static type checker. This will force you to make sure your code works as expected and saves you time during complicated Python projects. Why do you need this you ask? Because one day you'll accidentally pass a string instead of a tuple and you'll spend four hours debugging something so simple you'll feel like an idiot. We have the technology, we only have to use it.

#### Stepik

[Stepik](https://stepik.org/catalog) contains a collection of medium and low quality courses. It's like Jetbrains Academy, but include lots of free courses. I would recommend paying for a different service instead, with an exception being the Java challenges.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

* AlgoExpert
* BackToBack SWE
* [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/) provides developers with state-of-the-art tests for job interviews. They provide developers with a portal to access all of the tests to demonstrate your code proficiency. It supports every major language. It's like Leetcode, but way better, and 100% free. Bad for novices. 
* [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) is a way to achieve mastery through challenges. I used it before switching to CodeSignal.

### Web Development and Design

`Pass`

### Data Science & Visualization

`Pass`

### Game Development \(Unity and Unreal Engine\)

`Pass`

### Linux

`Pass`

### Machine Learning

`Pass`

### Operating Systems

Unfortunately, I took operating systems from a professor who did a poor job teaching remotely. This is a good place to start:

* [The Top 10 Operating Systems Concepts Software Developers Need to Remember](https://medium.com/cracking-the-data-science-interview/the-10-operating-system-concepts-software-developers-need-to-remember-480d0734d710)

## Business

## Marketing



## Professional Development

* BigInterview helps you develop your charismatic skills, but tailored to responding to interviews. 
* [Jobscan](https://www.jobscan.co/) optimizes your resume to increase hits by running it through the same software that career-hiring experts use to filter out good and bad candidates.
* Resume Star is a nice mac app that builds resumes for you. There should be a better way to do this, but Resume Star is a start. Building a resume takes too long though.
