# Reference Resources

## Computer Science

* [Codecademy Cheatsheets](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/cheatsheets/all) contains a wonderful collection of cheatsheets for multiple languages and tons of subjects.
* [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/) provides developers with state-of-the-art tests for job interviews. They provide developers with a portal to access all of the tests to demonstrate your code proficiency. It supports every major language. It's like Leetcode, but way better, and 100% free. 
* [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) is a way to achieve mastery through challenges. I used it before switching to CodeSignal.
* [Jetbrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/) contains a variety of hands-on learning projects for Python, Java, Javascript, Klotin. They are state-of-the-art. It grades your code style and works directly in IDEs like PyCharm and IntelliJ. This resource costs $50/month, but is worth it for one month or powering through a free-trial.
* [Stepik](https://stepik.org/catalog) contains a collection of medium and low quality courses. It's like Jetbrains Academy, but icludes lots of free courses.
