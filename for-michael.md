# For Michael Key

## What's Going On?

1. I'm reaching advanced levels of computer science.
   1. Stuff that doesn't come natural to me.
   2. Content is very math heavy.
2. Concepts are building on fundamental ideas I do not understand.

## What I've Tried

Ranked in order from most effective to least effective.

1. Participating in class _\(I'm often wrong and question everything I do, but I learn the most by failing and being corrected\)._
2. Taking notes using this platform. _\(The first step is to figure out what I don't know; good notes help me do that_ _and pay attention\)_.
3. Re-watching lectures.
4. Paid source of videos, Back to Back SWE. _\(Good: provides an overview, shows me what I don't know. Bad: Dr. Yao uses different notation/techniques sometimes. The audience is for those who have a grasp of this content already and are preparing for interviews\)._
5. YouTube videos: _\(Sometimes helpful, but it takes a long time to find a relevant one. Also, notation is different. Oftentimes, the quality is mediocre and not any more helpful than class videos\)._
6. Textbook. _\(It takes me forever, usually isn't worth reading\)._

## What Would Work Best:

1. Getting help from Dr. Yao. _\(But I'm afraid, because she's not a tutor\)._
2. Working through problems similar to homework with her or someone more knowledgeable. _\(Tutoring\)._
