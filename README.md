# Mike Chase's Notebook

## Situation

Throughout his life, Mike Chase has been obsessed with record keeping. First, he kept a giant notebook leaving blank pages like empty arrays until there were no more. Then, it became a massive OneNote notebook which he ran out of space. Notability worked as a temporary solution, but used this in conjunction with files and folders.

## Problem

Finally, I grew too impatient to keep up with every source of information. Coming up with computerized solutions to short-term projects and long-term projects has certainly not been my forte. That has not dissuaded me, however. After all, mastering note-taking, something I seem uniquely suited for, requires nothing short of a powerful mind.

## Solution

So, it's with great optimism that I once again present to you, the next generation of note-taking. I give you, a database filled with latex equations, handwritten notes attached as images, code samples, and plenty more.

## Evaluation

So far, it's received lavish praise. Please send me your feedback.
