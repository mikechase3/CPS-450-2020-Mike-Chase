The amortized cost, which we discussed in class, would be `O(1)`. The worst case cost is `O(n)` because you have to change every bit; however, since there is only an incremental operator, the amortized cost is `O(1)`.

### Aggregate Analysis for the K-Bit Counter

So obviously, by this point, we know two important things. And as a result of these two facts, we know that using amortized analyses is useful.

1. The worst case is `O(k)` because at some point, every single bit gets flipped. _This is when the array is when our_ `list = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`and every bit needs to get flipped.
2. Our average case is not going to be our worst case. Clearly, not every bit is getting flipped all the time.

#### Using Geometric Series

* The pattern we're noticing, `n`, `n/2`, `n/4`... is a [geometric series](https://media.pearsoncmg.com/cmg/pmmg_mml_shared/mathstats_html_ebooks/ThomasCalcET14e/page_592.html) because geometric series have the form:

$$
n + n/2 + n/4 + ... â‡’  \sum _{n=1}^{\infty } 2^{-n}=1
$$

If we graph this, it'll look exactly like this:

So clearly, this is a geometric series, and the series approaches 1:

$$
\sum _{n=1}^{\infty } 2^{-n}=1\
$$

#### Final Conclusions

1. The total cost of the sequence is `T(n) = O(n)`
2. The amortized cost per operation is `O(1)`.

### Accounting Method

* Recall, for the accounting method, we design an amortized cost _\(which is our budget\)_ for increment operations. 
* Here, we declared **our budget is $2**.
* And below, we **prove we have enough budget to cover `n` operations**. 
  * For every bit flip from 0 to 1, we use $1 for the flip.
  * We associate the extra $1 with bit 1, which will be used when we flip this bit from 1 back to 0.

#### Conclusions

Clearly, we have enough budget to cover all the bit flips. This means the balance is never negative. Therefore, we can **conclude** that **since the balance is never negative and our amortized cost for increment operation is $2 which is O\(1\), we can conclude our amortized cost per operation is `O(1)`. and the cost of `n` operations is** $$O(1) * n \in O(n)$$ .
