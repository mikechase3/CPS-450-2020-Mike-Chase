# Lecture 13: WEIGHTED Graph Representations

## Weighted Digraphs

* In [lecture 12](lecture-12-graph-fundamentals.md), we used directed graphs and showed that we store all the node objects as integers.
* Adjacency lists store outgoing nodes we point to in the Adjacency list.

When it comes to directed **weighted** graphs; however, we also have to specify the weight. In the example below, we'll store the **weights** as doubles as a new parameter in our adjacency list.
