Defining Undirected Graphs

* Let `V` be a finite set and `E` be a subset of $$\{e | e \subseteq V, |e|=2\}$$ . Then, the pair `G=(V, E)` is called an undirected graph.
* Self-loops are not allowed.
  * `e != {u, u} = {u}`

**Definition**: Let `V` be a finite set and `E` be a binary relation on V, that is,  $$E \subseteq V \cdot V$$ . Then, the pair `G=(V, E)` is called an directed graph.

**Self Loops** are allowed. `E` may contain `(v, v)`.
