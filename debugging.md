# Debugging

Alright - let's try a couple of things you recommended!  
O  
  
\#\# What Has/Hasn't Changed  
  
1. This still occurs on Brave.  
2. I found out that Safari is partially my fault/your fault... they put a status bar shortcut that is CTRL+ '/' so that command never makes it over to gitbook.  
  
  
----  
Now for some live testing. 



## With No Extensions

* It works perfectly.
* Wow!.
* What could be the problem?

That OR... it could be something with my cookies?



## Safari Issue

* `CMD + '/'` only turns the status bar on/off.
* I'm doing a time lapse, so it might not appear.
* But in the bottom left, a message that says 'status bar is on' appears when you use the shortcut.

{% hint style="info" %}
But sometimes... it works. I don't know what I just did!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Now it's doing both. It'll launch more menus & turn the status bar on/off.
{% endhint %}

## Back to Brave...

* Now Brave just worked all the sudden. W  Nope. Nevermind.  I spoke too soon.  Time to disable extensions...   Let's see if that's the culpret.

## Yes

* It was
* Now it works normally.
* Wow.

### Always blame the extensions.
