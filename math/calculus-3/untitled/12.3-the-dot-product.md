# 12.3: The Dot Product

## Goals

* Calculate the angle between two vectors directly from their components.
* Part of that calculation is the expression called the _dot product_.
* Dot products are _**scalar**_ products because the product results in a scalar, not a vector.

## Angle Between Vectors

* When the points of two vectors are palced, they from an angle Î˜.
