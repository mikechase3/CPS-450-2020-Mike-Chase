## 2.3: The Dot Product

### Review

* The dot product, or scalar product, of two vectors 𝐮=〈𝑢1,𝑢2,𝑢3〉u=〈u1,u2,u3〉 and 𝐯=〈𝑣1,𝑣2,𝑣3〉v=〈v1,v2,v3〉 is 𝐮·𝐯=𝑢1𝑣1+𝑢2𝑣2+𝑢3𝑣3.u·v=u1v1+u2v2+u3v3.
* The dot product satisfies the following properties:
  * 𝐮·𝐯=𝐯·𝐮u·v=v·u
  * 𝐮·\(𝐯+𝐰\)=𝐮·𝐯+𝐮·𝐰u·\(v+w\)=u·v+u·w
  * 𝑐\(𝐮·𝐯\)=\(𝑐𝐮\)·𝐯=𝐮·\(𝑐𝐯\)c\(u·v\)=\(cu\)·v=u·\(cv\)
  * 𝐯·𝐯=‖𝐯‖2v·v=‖v‖2
* The dot product of two vectors can be expressed, alternatively, as 𝐮·𝐯=‖𝐮‖‖𝐯‖cos𝜃.u·v=‖u‖‖v‖cosθ. This form of the dot product is useful for finding the measure of the angle formed by two vectors.
* Vectors **u** and **v** are orthogonal if 𝐮·𝐯=0.u·v=0.
* The angles formed by a nonzero vector and the coordinate axes are called the _direction angles_ for the vector. The cosines of these angles are known as the _direction cosines_.
* The vector projection of **v** onto **u** is the vector proj𝐮𝐯=𝐮·𝐯‖𝐮‖2𝐮.projuv=u·v‖u‖2u. The magnitude of this vector is known as the _scalar projection_ of **v** onto **u**, given by comp𝐮𝐯=𝐮·𝐯‖𝐮‖.compuv=u·v‖u‖.
* Work is done when a force is applied to an object, causing displacement. When the force is represented by the vector **F** and the displacement is represented by the vector **s**, then the work done _W_ is given by the formula 𝑊=𝐅·𝑠=‖𝐅‖‖𝐬‖cos𝜃.
