Note to self:

* omit new line at the bottom. Will screw up program.
* Usage: `python3 -m interface.main "this is my test quote" "my source" "my comment" "my_location.md"`
* Make sure you launch from the package \(notebook-mchase-me\), not the interface directory.

| Running away isn't the same as being free | Man in the High Castle S1 | I ran away from roommates, college, my job at Boll. I feel very free & comfy, but I wonder what life would've been like. I'm free. But am I satisfied? |
