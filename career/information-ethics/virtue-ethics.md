# Virtue Ethics

* Virtue Ethics is necessary for excellence and a good life.

## Plato

* Critiqued virtue ethics of the time.
* He did not like how different principles applied to different groups of people.
  * Men and women especially.
* Plato says there's _one_ good.

### Four Cardinal Virtues

* **Wisdom:** Allows us to interpret truths.
* **Courage:** Humans have a natural tendency to feel successful.
* **Self-Control \(Temperance\)**: Courage is a horse that wants to move forward regardless of hazards. Wisdom holds the reigns.

## Aristotle

* Aristotle has two types of goods:
* **Instrumental:** Good grades, money. It's not good in it of itself but helps us get what we want.
* **Intrinsic:** good for its own sake, not for something else. _ie. friendship._
* _**Eudaemonia**: Never instrumental, always intrinsic._

### Types of Virtue

* **Intellectual Virtues:** are a result of teaching.
* **Moral Virtues:** are a result of habit and how we choose to live our lives. \(Habit involves human choice, not being passive\).

### Defining Moral Virtue \(Book 2, Section 6\)

* Airstotle makes this argument very carefully.
* Aristotle categorizes groups. \(His favorite animal was the cuddlefish\).

### The Function Argument \(Book 1 Section 7\)

* The _good and well_ is though to reside in the function -&gt; man has function.
  * Man eats/breathes and all, but other animals do that.
  * Thinking and reasoning is what make men unique.
* There remains the active life of the element that has a rational principle.
* A virtue is good if it is performed by a good rational man in an excellent manner.
* Happiness is humans acting in accordance with virtue.

### Virtue Definition

* Virtue, then, is a state of character concerned with choice, lying in a mean, i.e. the mean relative to us, this being determined by a rational principle, and by that principle by which the man of practical wisdom would determine it.
* State of character concerned with voice -&gt; your state of mind you cultivated. \(How we choose to be\)
* Determined by a rational principle -&gt; living things have soles. Our function is thinking.
* Phronesis: practical wisdom. It's what someone an "expert in ethics" would determine.
* Lying in a mean relative to us... for next time.

### The Golden Mean

> Lying in a mean... relative to us.

* The mean between excess and deficiency of whatever ingredient would make it a moral virtue.
* **Relative to us**: the too hard/too soft is not calibrated to _The Hulk_. 
* An expert is able to take many factors into consideration. 

#### Cowardliness, Courage, and Recklessness

#### Insensibility, Temperance, Indulgence

![An advertisement for the prohibition.](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28250%29.png)

* Insensibility is a deficiency.
* Temperance is the mean
* Indulgence is excess.

#### Generosity: Meanness, Liberality, Prodigality

* Meanness: Too little
* Liberality: Mean
* Excess: prodigality

#### Humor: Borishness, Wit, Buffoonery

* Boorishness: Deficiency
* Wit: Mean
* Buffoonery: excess

## Immanuel Kant

* Morality must be rooted in _reason_, not _emotion_. 

### The Categorical Imperative

* Act as though the maxim of your action were to become, through your will, a universal law of nature \(24\).
  * A _maxim_ is any actionable statement. Like "everyone should not lie."
  * It needs to be **universal** 
  * No contradictions are allowed.
* You must be able to rationally establish that all other rational beings must always do this action as a matter of moral course.
* Everyone has to follow these because _everyone_ has the ability to be rational \(26\).
  * Except slaves maybe.
* Do not _use_ people, but respect everyone's dignity even though we're all sort-of using our employers as means for a paycheck and employers using us as a means for profit.
  * We're also treated with respect and freely-choosing individuals.

### Hedonic Calculus

* **Sensation**: Intensity, Duration, Certainty/Uncertainty \(Obviousness of Sensation\), Propinquity.
* **Relationship:** Fecundity \(Fruitfulness/Racism\). Purity \(absence of side effects\).
