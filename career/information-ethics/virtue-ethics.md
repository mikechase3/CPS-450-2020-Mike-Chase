# Virtue Ethics

* Virtue Ethics is necessary for excellence and a good life.

## Plato

* Critiqued virtue ethics of the time.
* He did not like how different principles applied to different groups of people.
  * Men and women especially.
* Plato says there's _one_ good.

### Four Cardinal Virtues

* **Wisdom:** Allows us to interpret truths.
* **Courage:** Humans have a natural tendency to feel successful.
* **Self-Control \(Temperance\)**: Courage is a horse that wants to move forward regardless of hazards. Wisdom holds the reigns.

## Aristotle

* Aristotle has two types of goods:
* **Instrumental:** Good grades, money. It's not good in it of itself but helps us get what we want.
* **Intrinsic:** good for its own sake, not for something else. _ie. friendship._
* _**Eudaemonia**: Never instrumental, always intrinsic._

### Types of Virtue
* **Intellectual Virtues:** are a result of teaching.
* **Moral Virtues:** are a result of habit and how we choose to live our lives. (Habit involves human choice, not being passive).

### Defining Moral Virtue (Book 2, Secion 6)
* Airstotle makes this argument very carefully.
* Aristotle categorizes groups. (His favorite animal was the cuddlefish).

### The Function Argument (Book 1 Section 7)
* The _good and well_ is though to reside in the function -> man has function.
  * Man eats/breathes and all, but other animals do that.
  * Thinking and reasoning is what make men unique.
* There remains the active life of the element that has a rational principle.
* A virtue is good if it is performed by a good rational man in an excellent manner.
* Happiness is humans acting in accordance with virtue.

### Virtue Definition
* Virtue, then, is a state of character concerned with choice, lying in a mean, i.e. the mean relative to us, this being determined by a rational principle, and by that principle by which the man of practical wisdom would determine it.
* State of character concend with voice -> your state of mind you cultivated. (How we choose to be)
* Determined by a rational principle -> living things have soles. Our function is thinking.
* Phronesis: practical wisdom. It's what someone an "expert in ethics" would determine.
* Lying in a mean relative to us... for next time.
