# Computer Ethics

## What is Computer Ethics?

* Computer ethics is the **analysis of the nature and social impact** of computer technology and the **corresponding formulation and justification of policies** for the ethical use of these technologies.
* There must be computer technology involved and uncertainty about what to do and how to understand the situation.

## The Industrial Revolution Continuation

* There's an important paper called "Car Computer History": [link](https://itstillruns.com/car-computer-history5082250.html).
* The computer is special because of 'logical malleability' meaning that the logic works differently somehow idk.
